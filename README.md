## Development

A server is not required, as long as the files are served off an `http`/`https` origin.

If you need a server, use [nginx](http://nginx.org/en/) or a simple server such as Python's:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

Then to load a prototype, start in the `catalogue` directory. I'd recommend starting with [Catalogue Prototype E](http://localhost:8000/catalogue/e/).
